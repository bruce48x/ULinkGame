# ULinkGame.Server.Hotfix.Generators

Source generators for ULinkGame server hotfix systems.

The first generator slice discovers `[HotfixState]` partial classes and emits generated friend accessors for private fields.

```csharp
[HotfixState]
public partial class PlayerActor
{
    private int exp;
}
```

Generates an editor-hidden accessor similar to:

```csharp
public int __hotfix_exp()
{
    return exp;
}
```

Types marked `[HotfixState]` must be partial. Nested hotfix state also requires partial containing types. Compiler-generated backing fields, static fields, and const fields are ignored.

Generated accessors are public by necessity: they live in the stable assembly and must be callable from the separate hotfix assembly. They are hidden from normal IntelliSense but are not a security boundary. `[FriendOf]` identifies the intended hotfix system relationship; it does not prevent other code with a stable-state reference from calling generated `__hotfix_` members.

Full wrapper discovery from hotfix project method declarations is intentionally staged after the first runtime integration. Current samples use explicit stable wrappers while the generator supplies friend accessors.
